~ Act I ~

What do you think your mind wanders off to, when you are sleeping?

Do we die?

But we breath while sleeping right? So how can we die?

All these questions because I don't think there is much difference between a good night sleep and...

DEATH.

~ Act II ~

Were we born to just die one day?

You learn how to walk.
You learn how to shit.
You learn how to make money.
You learn how to do things.

Then we all just die.

Is that it?

Is that really the best we can do, to ourselves?

I recently asked my friend (who seems to be attracted to the idea of visiting as many countries as he could) this question...

"Have you ever had any real motivation behind your action, behind every decision you made? Are we here to procreate and die? Just like any animal?"

We earn money.
We spend money.
We live.
We die.

That's what I have always did and that's what I'll do.

.. he said.

~ Act III ~

Help others.
Donate.
Be good to others.
Smile.
Work hard.
Study.
Achieve your dreams

That's what we are taught right?

But do we stop and ask ourselves, what is it that we want?
THE MOST.

I rarely do it.

~ Act IV ~

Consciousness.

Have you ever wondered what consciousness is?
It is the state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.

That's taken from the internet.

But tell me my imaginary friend, have you ever *experienced* consciousness.

I do.
When I close my eyes.
